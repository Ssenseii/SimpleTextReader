                        as a kid because I didn&rsquo;t understand the need for
                        them. Once I turned eighteen though. I was forced to
                        enter the world of adults where the need for
                        companionship is more appealing and solitude is regarded
                        negatively. By that point, I had no social skills and I
                        had no desire to experience humiliation any more than I
                        already did from my embarrassing attempts.</span

                        Approaching some guys sitting on the bleachers in front
                        of me. It was a sunny January morning, a cold breeze
                        coloring my cheeks red while the sun warmed my hands.
                        The yard was empty except for the five of us. The rest
                        were either in class or at home. I had a free period and
                        was reading a book. Loud noises from a group of guys
                        woke me up from my trance. They seemed nice and
                        cheerful. One of them was showing the others a video
                        clip on his phone and they were all laughing, pointing
                        at the phone and laughing even harder. Amused at the
                        thought of a cat falling in a bath or an idiot dropping
                        his birthday cake. I slowly slid along the planks,
                        getting closer while thinking of what to say to them.
                        I&rsquo;ve never had friends before and this was my
                        chance to gain some. They were in a good mood and
                        nothing could go wrong if I was confident enough. That
                        was the internet&rsquo;s advice and I was taking it to
                        heart.</span

                        composed and thought-out joke? I slid slowly behind them
                        and squinted at the phone. The naked body of one of our
                        classmates getting pounded in a dark room, lit only by
                        the flashlight of the camera. Her face is zoomed in and
                        I recognize her. It&rsquo;s Alice and she always seemed
                        like a nice person. This is wrong. They shouldn&rsquo;t
                        be laughing at her personal life. I tried to silently
                        fall back but they noticed me.</span

                        I was despised in school even though it wasn&rsquo;t my

                        leaned over the railing of the wooden bridge leading to
                        my part of town. The air was cold and the sky felt

                        pipe. My school bag was stolen alongside my wallet and

                        grew long and redwood sprang where the sun shone.
                        I&rsquo;ve loved that forest since I was a kid. I went
                        on adventures exploring, trailing animals, collecting
                        plants, and camping. I knew the entire topography from
                        the narrow creek up north to the rabbit warren down
                        south. From the cow barn out west to the bridge I was
                        standing on. I knew I&rsquo;d be safe sleeping there
                        tonight and going home tomorrow. With my broken leg, I
                        could just about reach one place. The red cave was my
                        only refuge for the night.</span

                        towards a deep lake connected to the previously
                        mentioned creek. The deep lake shines a teal color when
                        struck with sunlight, ever-changing into cyan under the
                        moonlight. The trees plant their roots deep in the
                        ground close to the lake, growing firm with thick
                        shrubbery and long branches. Squirrels jump from one
                        tree to another, Owls silently fly across the land
                        looking for mice and foxes resting by the waterside. It
                        was a mini-ecosystem and it was still the same after all
                        those years. The bear cave itself was nothing special.
                        Surrounded by stone from either side and digs in a slope
                        after a few steps. Moss hangs from the entrance and red
                        berries grow on the front.

                        never left this spot after so many years. The moon shone
                        on the entrance and the reeds were surrounded by
                        fireflies. I washed my face and hands in the lake and
                        sat in front of the cave staring at the moon.</span

                        loved. Not the gut crunching loneliness I felt every day
                        since joining the world. My expeditions here when I was
                        young were the happiest days of my life, staring at the
                        vastness of the wild across from the cave. Listening to
                        the gentle falling water. Watching space and counting
                        stars. But at that moment, It was a reminder of how I
                        failed in the game of life. All I wanted was some
                        company, I wanted a friend or a companion to share my
                        books and have lunch together. A friend who understands
                        me and believes in me. Someone I can count on and they
                        could count on me. It was my only wish and it was lost.
                        The tears ran across my disfigured face and I
                        couldn&#39;t stop them. I wanted to cry.</span

                        symbol of rage as the anger boiled deep in my heart. The
                        auburn leaves land on the lake and settle, creating
                        ripples across the serene void. That&rsquo;s where I
                        wanted to be. Somewhere calm, Somewhere devoid of hate

                        was clear as snow and my walk normal. My broken leg

                        hadn&rsquo;t been getting much of it before that day. My
                        dreams had turned into nightmares about suicides and
                        people killing themselves. I&rsquo;d dreamt about the
                        students in my school drowning in the deep lake or
                        getting mauled by bears. They were angry dreams,
                        displaying the sort of feelings I&rsquo;ve never had
                        before, like a newly found grudge or years of suppressed
                        anger resurfacing. I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a
                        passive person and I wished that incident didn&rsquo;t
                        change me into a bitter personality. Someone who&rsquo;d
                        do bad things to other people just because they felt sad
                        for themselves. I, also, saw Alice in my dreams. Her
                        naked frigid body was entangled by rose bushes, her
                        blood getting sucked by thorns springing from the vines.
                        I felt like a psycho.

                        one of them was taking off his pants &ldquo;Hey pervert,

                        and I tried fighting back. But the two jocks outweighed
                        me. I closed my eyes. I couldn&rsquo;t push them away
                        from me, I had no one to help me at that moment. I heard
                        a girl try to keep them off me but they pushed her back.
                        She ran out of the room to look for the teacher. It was
                        too late. I felt angry. I felt the same hatred I felt
                        under the moonlight in that sorrowful lake. I felt
                        powerless and fragile. I didn&rsquo;t belong in their
                        world and this was my punishment. I wished I would just

                        of my soul. He was a tall humanoid figure. His
                        &ldquo;headpiece&rdquo; consisted of four skulls in a

                        today before the end,&rdquo; He says with a vibrating,
                        ominous sound coming from the depth of his robe. He
                        steps away slowly to pick up a bone ax by the courtyard.

                        gruesome powers, at least until they reached the throne
                        again. A deep bond was necessary for the demon and the

                        weren&rsquo;t sealed in certain locations, unable to
                        wander. The two subjects shared hatred of humans, for a

                        one classmate, the one who tried to help him. He
                        bargained a deal with the blood demon, a taste of his

                        pain using light and water. There were also The
                        Soulmates. They managed to sit between good and evil.
                        Their apocalypse consisted of splitting Earth in half
                        and recalibrating it for better living conditions in the

                        &nbsp;We spoke first of the demons possessing us. She
                        explained to me their past. Ketsueki, rarely but
                        continuously, corrected her when it came to his past.
                        Then she spoke of her life; At first, it was hard facts:
                        Orphan, Raised by a demon, Trained to hone her
                        skills&hellip; then her facts turned into thoughts,
                        emotions started to seep in. Her feelings of loneliness
                        were displayed under the guise of strength. She was
                        brave, fearless, and ruthless. She stood her ground
                        against titans and beasts to reach her goals, but when
                        it came to normal life. She couldn&rsquo;t relate to her
                        coworkers who revered her, she couldn&rsquo;t connect
                        with &ldquo;weak&rdquo; humans, whom she can easily add
                        to her shrine of undying substitutes.</span

                        I was looking for friends and I found one most
                        inconceivably. A friend who accepted me for who I am,

                        the humans&#39; souls and feeding on them. While the

                        while the rich enjoyed their winds and oceans. It went

                        would bring her favorite books to share and he would

                        happening in their lives. Oliver didn&rsquo;t have much
                        to say. His monotonous routine never changed. She talked
                        about her university courses and chatted about her
                        friends. He always felt a sliver of jealousy whenever

                        said something funny, but he let that feeling go.

                        all day, although that&rsquo;s what made him charming in

                        burrowed into his lap, laughing at his dumb jokes or
                        making her own. In their silence, they listened to the
                        creek and tiny waterfalls, he fiddled with her hair
                        while reading his favorite book in a comical fashion. He

                        forest alerting them of danger. The three heard a

                        the cabin&rsquo;s wooden planks, flowers and pantry
                        flying in the air. His home had just been bombarded.
                        Julie got up frightened while Oliver sat where he was,
                        analyzing in his head who in their right mind would
                        attack his home. He planted his hand under the grass and

                        unbreathable toxic gas. The armor kept the poison

                        waiting for his mutants to strike. The marine listened

                        the cries of a monster, the stridulations of a giant

                        down his armor and pulled the cobalt sword. A hum of
                        energy vibrated from the blade while he struck the slimy
                        worm coming after him from the left. His blade went
                        through the middle of its large prostomium, dazzled with
                        hundreds of shiny teeth buzzing like a chainsaw. The
                        worm&rsquo;s body slid on either side of his sword until
                        it split in half. Its mutated intestines leaked toxic
                        acid on the ground. His son landed right next to him,
                        turning a rock into gravel, with the head of a black
                        Beatle bleeding through his luminescent sword and the
                        marks of its mandibles clear on his helmet. They shook
                        off the acid of their swords and watched each
                        other&rsquo;s backs. The centipede&rsquo;s rattle
                        sounded closer. It was time to clear the air. The marine
                        shot in front of him a blank shot. A whirlwind,
                        accompanied by a fat bass sound, pushed through the
                        smoke, clearing the path before them towards the

                        Siobhan came to have dinner with me the night before and

                        unusually reclused and silent. Siobhan didn&rsquo;t text

                        wandering around the city now and then, trying to find

                        overpowered by a newfound ego. I could crush and break
                        anyone in my way. Maybe the demon saw in me something I

                        voice. The demon rushed through the space between the

                        went dim. To his surprise, the giant mechanical soldier

                        on the pavement, turning it to dust. He shot three
                        golden bullets into his cranium, which didn&rsquo;t have
                        the same effect on him as they did for Toxin. He kept
                        him pinned to the ground under his knee while cramming
                        his claws down the demon&rsquo;s chest, Fuji started

                        melted, leaving the marine holding a pool of blood. Fuji
                        was in full escape mode. He didn&rsquo;t know who that
                        soldier was, but the energy around him was intimidating:
                        the scars on the metal platings, the steady resolve, the
                        speed of his strike&hellip; He was sure that machine or
                        whatever had been the one who killed Toxin. Ketsueki
                        kneeled on his bone chair inside Fuji&rsquo;s mind,
                        recuperating. They had to regroup with Siobhan,
                        she&rsquo;d know who that is and how they could stop
                        him.

                        the angel midair, through the glass, and reeled him in
                        against the concrete wall and mirrors shards. Fuji kept
                        on running and turning corners, sending his demon to
                        delay the forthcoming attacks and bringing him back.
                        When he got tired, he accidentally wished he could be
                        any faster. Fortunately, the demon heard the wish and
                        slithered across Fuji&rsquo;s body in streaks of blood.
                        His muscles grew larger, his back expanded and his feet
                        pounded the ground beneath them.

                        rails, and ledges. Flying across from one side to
                        another. The marine equipped his machine gun, which
                        carved into the building with streaks of tiny even
                        holes. Bullets followed Fuji wherever he went, sometimes

                        the building by himself using integrated rocket boots to
                        jump between the building and the one across from it.

                        of mutant monsters, lost to the marine.</span
