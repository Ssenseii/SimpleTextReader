## Background

When I was 19 years old, I wrote a science fiction book about old demons and their servitors...
I came about the idea of making the reading experience accessible, when I found it was hard to make an epub without wasting my life away with a software from 2002, that wouldn't even give me the options to make it accessible for everyone.

## Goals

  -Displaying my work in a customizable environement of my own choosing.
  -Making my work easily readable and customizable with all kinds of tools such as:
      -fonts
      -colors

## License

 I never entended for my book to be commercialized.
 It's just a life achievement to be able to tell your friends you wrote a book at 19.
